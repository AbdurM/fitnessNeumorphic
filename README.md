Weekend 008 of #WeekendMobileUIChallenge.

Xamarin controls used:
Neocontrols (Pre-release)
Pancakeview

I have challenged myself to write Code for one UI using either Xamarin Forms  every weekend. I will be picking up designs from websites such as dribbble.com where skilled designers post their work.
